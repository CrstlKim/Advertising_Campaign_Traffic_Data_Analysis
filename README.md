# Advertising Campaign Traffic Data Analysis
## The analysis involved identifying critical factors that drive qualified shopper performance, as well as pinpointing opportunities to grow the number of qualified shoppers. The insights and implications drawn from the analysis provided valuable information for the business to make informed decisions.
